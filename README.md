## Relevant Resources

### 1. Auto Patrol
#### Ground Station Software
* [Choosing a Ground Station](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-choosing-a-ground-station.html) 
* [Mission Planner](https://github.com/ArduPilot/MissionPlanner)
* [QGroundControl, QGC](http://qgroundcontrol.com/)

#### SITL
* [SITL Simulator (Software in the loop)](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-simulator-software-in-the-loop.html)

  If you use Mission Plannerï¼Œyou can download and connect SITL from its simulation section.

  If you use QGC, you will need to install SITL manually.

  `Mission Planner is written in C#, so it would be a little bit tricky to install and use it on a macbook.`
